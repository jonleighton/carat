Carat
=====

Carat is a Ruby-like programming language written in Ruby. It was written for the third year project as part of my Computer Science degree. You can download the write-up here if you like: http://dump.jonathanleighton.com/project.pdf

I gave a talk to the London Ruby User Group about it, on July 12th 2010. They have put the slide up here: http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/carat-an-interpreted-language-written-in-ruby. They also filmed it, but unfortunately don't seem to have uploaded that (the slide don't make a lot of sense on their own).
