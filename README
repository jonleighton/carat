Carat
-----

Carat is a Ruby-like programming language written in Ruby.

Its goal is to be very simple language with a straightforward, understandable implementation. I intend to use it to explore different ideas for syntax and semantics.

Carat is currently written as an interpreter, but I may implement it as a virtual machine and compiler in the future.

I'm working on this as an academic project during the 3rd year of my degree at Oxford University. It will be under heavy development until about March 2010.
