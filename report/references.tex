\section{References}

I have drawn inspiration from the following sources:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Mike Spivey, my project supervisor.
  
  \item Patrick Farley's explanations of the Ruby object model at \url{http://www.klankboomklang.com/}. The Carat object model is based on Ruby's, although there are some differences.
  
  \item Smalltalk-80: The Language and its Implementation, Goldberg and Robson, Addison-Wesley, ISBN: 0-201-11371-6. This book describes a bytecode interpreter, but my implementation of primitives was inspired by it.
  
  \item Essentials of Programming Languages, Third Edition, Friedman and Wand, MIT Press, ISBN: 978-0-262-06279-4
  
  \item Ruby, obviously.
\end{enumerate}
