  An interpreter was written, which attempted to distil the `essence of Ruby' and
  to explore the syntax and semantics of the language. The interpreter itself was written in Ruby,
  and a key objective was to structure the code as simply and clearly as possible, keeping the
  level of complexity low while still implementing a range of interesting and powerful language
  features.
