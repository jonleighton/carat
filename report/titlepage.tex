  In order to study the intricacies of programming language implementation, an interpreter for a 
  language similar to Ruby was written, dubbed ``Carat". The interpreter itself was written in
  Ruby, and a lot of effort went into keeping the level of complexity low, while still implementing
  a range of interesting and powerful language features.
